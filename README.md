flatiron-playlister
===================

-  fork this repositry
    -  clone it locally
    -  'git add remote upstream git@github.com:oneteam-onedream/flatiron-playlister.git'
    -  'checkout -b your_feature_name' try to use descriptive name for branch eg. 'spotify-web', etc
    -  when feature is complete, push your feature branch up to the repo on your github account(origin)
    -  make a pull request to merge your feature branch to the oneteam-onedream repo
    -  do not merge your pull requests, we should all be on the same page about the content being merged
    -  when you work, be sure to be up to date with the upstream/master branch. It's good habit to pull often
    -  AWESOME!
